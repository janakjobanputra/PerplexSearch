## Overview
The Perplexity Quick Search Extension is a Chrome browser extension that enables users to search selected text directly in Perplexity without manual copy-pasting or tab navigation. This streamlines the research workflow for Perplexity users.

## Problem Statement
Currently, searching text in Perplexity requires multiple steps:
1. Selecting text
2. Copying text
3. Opening a new tab
4. Navigating to Perplexity
5. Pasting the text
6. Initiating the search

This process creates unnecessary friction for users who frequently use Perplexity for research and information gathering.

## Goals
- Reduce the number of steps required to search text in Perplexity
- Improve user productivity when conducting research
- Provide a seamless integration between web browsing and Perplexity searches

## Non-Goals
- Supporting browsers other than Chrome
- Modifying or interacting with Perplexity's search results
- Adding additional search functionality beyond text selection
- Supporting image or link-based searches

## User Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Users must be able to select any text on a webpage
2. Upon right-clicking selected text, a context menu option for Perplexity search must appear
3. Clicking the context menu option must open Perplexity in a new tab
4. The selected text must be automatically entered as a search query in Perplexity
5. The extension must work on all websites (where text selection is possible)

### Technical Requirements
1. Chrome Extension manifest v3 compatibility
2. Required permissions:
   - Context menu access
   - Text selection access
   - Tab creation capability
3. Background service worker for handling context menu events
4. Proper URL encoding of selected text for search queries

## User Experience
